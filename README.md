# cctv_zoom_super_resolution


When you check your CCTV and found out that something look strange, what should you do?

You may zoom in the stopped image in the video.

But in many cases, the zoomed image is easy to be down-scaled.

This program will help you to upscale the image you have chosen through zooming the image in your CCTV video.

You can stop the video with space bar and choose the part of video you want to zoom with dragging your cursor.

Also you can go back 15sec ago with '[' and 15sec after with ']'

You can then press 'a' to zoom out and 'd' to zoom in.

Press 'q' to destroy the dragged image window and press 'esc' to destroy all the windows.
